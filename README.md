## Steps on How to Create a GitHub Page:
1. First, create a repository and push your `index.html` and `style.css` files.
2. From your repository, go to its **Settings** and scroll down to the **Pages** section under the **Code and Automation** category.
3. Under the **Build and Deployment** section, select **Deploy from a branch**.
4. Under **Branch**, use the dropdown menu and select a publishing source (I used `Static`).
5. After selecting the source and branch, GitHub Pages will show you the live URL.

## Key Takeaways:
- Web development is not a joke; there is a lot to learn and memorize when it comes to creating websites using **HTML** and designing using **CSS**. It can be overwhelming to fully grasp everything immediately.
- I found creating my own web portfolio to be fun, as I could freely express my creativity and showcase my accomplishments to present myself online.
- Overall, learning HTML and CSS is a necessary skill, especially if you want to establish your first personal website and demonstrate your creative skills in designing your own web pages.
