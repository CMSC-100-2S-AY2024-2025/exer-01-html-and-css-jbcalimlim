Steps on how to create a github page: 
    1. First create a repository and push your index.html and style.css file.
    2. From your repository go to its settings and scroll down to the Pages section under the Code and Automation Category.
    3. Under the Build and deployment section under source, select Deploy from a branch.
    4. Under Branch, use the branch dropdown menu and select a publishing source.
    5. After selecting the source and branch, GitHub Pages will show you the live URL.
Key Takeaways: Web development is not a joke, there are lots to know and needed to memorize when it comes to creating websites using HTML and designing using CSS, and it might be close to impossible to fully grasp them all immediately. I found creating my own web portfolio to be fun as I could freely express my creativity and showcase my accomplishments as a means to introduce and present myself online. Overall, learning HTML and CSS is a necessary skill especially if you want to establish your first personal website and demonstrate your creative skills in designing your own web pages.
